# Town and Dungeons
This is a typing game in RPG style.

## Overview
The subjects are PHP, JS, HTML, CSS function names, tag names, etc.
Successful typing will attack and defeat enemies to gain experience, level up, and become stronger.

In the town, you can recover, change jobs, and train.
In the initial state, enemies are more evasive.
Since you have money in your pocket from the beginning, we recommend that you train a little before typing.

There are differences in ability values and skills in each occupation.
Please use the occupation of your choice to complete the course.

I made this game to study PHP object-oriented programming.
Please try to play with it.
